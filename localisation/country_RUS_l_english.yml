 RUS_strategic_bomber_desc:0 "The greatest way to destroy an enemy is to destroy their infrastructure, factories, and centers of operation. There is no way better to do this then through strategic bombing operations, and with the power of Russian aviation technology at our back, the natives of this world will never see our bombers coming until it's too late."
 RUS_better_engine:0 "Better Jet Engines"
 RUS_better_engine_desc:0 "With new materials and natural phenomenon such as magic now at our disposal, the potential to create even more powerful and efficient jet engines then we ever could with our normal technology, is a huge reality. Our next generation of aircraft will be the most powerful and quickest planes to ever be produced in history."
 RUS_AA_missiles_focus:0 "Guided Missiles"
 RUS_AA_missiles_focus_desc:0 "Modern air combat is done mostly with missiles nowadays, occasionally with cannons or machineguns mounted onto fighters. With this air doctrine, we hold a massive advantage over the natives, for one of our planes could easily destory five of theirs with guided missiles tracking and destroying their aircraft. With more modern aircraft being produced or researched, it's time to start equipping missiles on to our planes."

 RUS_create_naval_base:0 "Create a Naval Base"
 RUS_create_naval_base_desc:0 "Back on Earth, our glorious navy lies in the frozen and radioactive waters of our seas and oceans, but we can resurrect our great navy on this new world with the blueprints we managed to save. However, we must first create a naval base and shipyards if we're going to put these blueprints to use."
 RUS_baltic_fleet:0 "Create a Baltic Fleet"
 RUS_baltic_fleet_desc:0 "By adapting our new Soviet Navy to the tactics of the fleet of the Baltic Sea, our fleet will adopt a more fast and nimble approach. By taking advantage of our technological superiority over the natives, our use of stealth submarines and large packs of advanced destroyers will absolutely destroy even the most advanced and powerful native ships. The battleships of this world shall be sent to the bottoms of the ocean."
 RUS_pacific_fleet:0 "Create a Pacific Navy"
 RUS_pacific_fleet_desc:0 "While the ocean that expands beyond our shores is nowhere close to the size of the grand Pacific Ocean back on Earth, the ocean is still vast and expansive. Launching large and heavily armed ships into this ocean with our most devastating and advanced anti-ship and anti-air equipement on it, will manifest the Soviet Navy into a world dominating force more powerful then the British Royal Navy."
 RUS_Kanin:0 "Kotlin-Class Destroyer"
 RUS_Kanin_desc:0 "A tough and old reliable class of destroyer from 1950's, the Kotlin destroyers will be enough to provide a tough shield of defense around our coast for some years. Equipped with radar and guns with high rate of fire, they will be a nasty and intimidating surprise to anyone coming near our shores."
 RUS_Kashin:0 "Kashin-Class Destroyer"
 RUS_Kashin_desc:0 "A far more advanced destroyer, but still a bit outdated, this class of destroyer is still decades ahead of anything the natives can produce, and can pack quite a punch. While we haven't produced any anti-ship missiles yet, the Kashin is still strong enough to stand against a vast majority of ships on this world."
 RUS_victor_class_submarine:0 "Victor-class Submarine"
 RUS_victor_class_submarine_desc:0 "Although rather small, size can be a very manipluative thing. The Victor-class nuclear submarine has shown it's combat effective abilities many times, and while our nation can't really create a nuclear reactor for the submarine at the moment, outfitting them with more traditional methods of power will get these subs out into the ocean and create a serious threat towards any native ship."
 RUS_akula_class_submarine:0 "Akula-class Submarine"
 RUS_akula_class_submarine_desc:0 "This submarine is the most newest addition to the Soviet Navy, so new in fact that one of these submarines was never able to be built before the bombs dropped. There is no better way to test this new design then in the new oceans of this world! This will probably the biggest submarine to ever be built on this world as of now, and it will be capable of travelling far to survey the enemy fleets, and inflict heavy damage."
 RUS_kara_class:0 "Kresta I-class Cruiser"
 RUS_kara_class_desc:0 "While this missile crusier is not specifically built for gun engagement, the Kresta I can be refitted with technologically superior guns and anti-air defenses with deadly computer aided accuracy. Once we're able to requip this vessel with anti-ship missile, the Kresta I-class will become a ship that will be feared around the world."
 RUS_sovremennyy_class:0 "Sovremenny-class Destroyer "
 RUS_sovremennyy_class_desc:0 "While classified as a destroyer that operates exactly like one, this vessel is an enormous and powerful destroyer that might as well be classified as a small and heavily armed battlecruiser on this world's standards. Equipping this ship with Anti-ship missiles and state of the art technology will transform this destroyer into real sea monster that will destroy everything in its path."
 RUS_Kirov:0 "Kirov-class Battlecruiser"
 RUS_Kirov_desc:0 "The Kirov battlecruiser is one of the Soviet Navy's most recent and largest ship built to date. Powered by a nuclear flame, this powerful and mighty vessel was designed with a massive armament of anti-ship missiles onboard, but the Kirov is a modern battleship without it's guns. Equipping the Kirov with enourmous and hard-hitting modern guns, while keeping it's huge anti-ship missile stockpile, it will become our enemy’s worst nightmare."
 RUS_Kuznetsov:0 "The Admiral"
 RUS_Kuznetsov_desc:0 "Named after the great Admiral Nikolai Kuznetsov, the Kuznetsov-Class would have been the pride of the entire Soviet Navy if it had been built before the world was lit up in a nuclear fire. We shall finish the construction of this great aircraft carrier in this new world, and with the combined efforts of the Soviet people, we shall honor the name of Kuznetsov by making this carrier the most powerful seafaring vessel on the planet."
 RUS_missile_warfare:0 "Reimplant Missile Warfare"
 RUS_missile_warfare_desc:0 "At last, we have gathered the materials needed to begin production of anti-ship missiles! Equipping the newly reformed Soviet Navy with these missiles will give us an advantage like no other against the natives, destroying fleets of their ships from afar and crippling their morale and navy. Their puny 'warships' will crumble before the power and might of the Soviet Navy!"

 RUS_strategic_force:0 "Strategic Missile Troops"
 RUS_strategic_force_desc:0 "Although we came to this world expecting to live our days in peace, we have been struck by the reality of our situation...peace is still a faraway thing. Whether it be for securing the future of the Russian people, or securing peace in this world by intimidation and force, we will do what we must. This world will know know the true horrors of nuclear weapons like Tsar Bomba...don't expect this to sit well with the people."

 RUS_socialism_with_human_face_desc:0 "Even if in the future the ‘human’ face is going to be disputable, this program inspired by the Czechoslovak Alexander Dubček will be the foundation for our change into our new and more democratic political system! A vast majority of the people of the Soviet Union will be excited to hear this news, and hopefully pressure certain government officals to cooperate with Gorbachev." 
 RUS_approach_europe:0 "Approach Europe"
 RUS_approach_europe_desc:0 "The Soviet Union and Western Europe have a long history of rivalry and war, but in the dire situation we find ourselves in, we must remember that the western Europeans are our brothers and sisters.

This starts by establishing solid commercial and political relations with Europe."
 RUS_reform_agriculture:0 "Reform Agriculture"

 RUS_civilian_economy_reform_desc:0 "As much as we hate to admit it, the communist economy used by the past leaders of the Soviet Union just doesn't work anymore, as evident by our declining economy before the nuclear holocaust. We need to update it to hold some resemblences to the Western European and US economical systems."
 RUS_reform_industry:0 "Reform our Industry"
 RUS_reform_industry_desc:0 "Our workers have worked tirelessly and with an iron heart in the past several years to provide food, shelter, and security for our people.

But that can change now, and for their efforts we will make sure our workers ger better pay and better work conditions."
 RUS_arab_population_tension:0 "Appease the Arab Tension"
 RUS_arab_population_tension_desc:0 "Midst the chaos of fleeing Earth, we didn’t care who was who, we just tried to save as many people as humanly possible. In our evacuation, we managed to save millions of Europeans, but also Arabs, Turks, Kurds, and many more. When things began settling down, tensions began to rise again between all these ethnic populations. This is putting lives, and our Union in danger. We need to find some kind of solution."
 RUS_approach_USA:0 "Approach the USA"
 RUS_approach_USA_desc:0 "Approaching the United States directly and not within the halls of some neutral locations is easier said then done. The looks we were getting from the Americans alone at the Canterlot Summit was enough to put any soldier on edge, after all our conflict just destroyed Earth. However. they aren’t totally closed to diplomatic dialogue, we need to try to contact them and calm this entire situation..."
 RUS_detente:0 "Detente"
 RUS_detente_desc:0 "With some contacts inside Congress, we can try our best help the American people reclaim their freedom, and help restore some democratic institutions within the country.

 RUS_finish_reform:0 "Finish the Reforms"
 RUS_finish_reform_desc:0 "What seemed impossible just some few years ago, is finally accomplished. The great Soviet economy is stable and on the rise, our farms are producing more food then ever, our factories are better then ever, and overall the people seem to be pretty happy about all of these reforms! But with the country now in a much better and happy state, we should begin looking outside our borders to establish our Union's place in the world."

 RUS_visit_canterlot:0 "Official Visit at Canterlot"
 RUS_visit_canterlot_desc:0 "Gorbachev has managed to maintain friendly relations with Princess Celestia and Princess Luna, as well as some Equestrian nobles.

We should establish official communications, Velvet will be more then happy to hear from us."

RUS_Olenia_Treaty_desc:0 "Not surprisingly, Queen Velvet has made a clear announcement that she wishes to further strengthen ties between our two countries.

 RUS_support_agri:0 "Support Agriculture"
 RUS_support_agri_desc:0 "Our agriculture system is good enough, there is no need to change a system that has managed to get the job done. It just needs a bit more funding, that should help boost the efficiency of our farms a little bit."
 RUS_support_indus:0 "Support Industry"
 RUS_support_indus_desc:0 "Our industry has always been the heart of the Soviet Union and the communist system!

 RUS_replace_gorby:0 "Replace Gorbachev"
 RUS_replace_gorby_desc:0 "From day one, Gorbachev has not only been dangerous for the Communist party, but outright treasonous! His reforms are too radical, and they open up far too much to things such as capitalism, which would absolutely destroy the Soviet Union.

 RUS_take_care_arab:0 "Take Care of the Arabs"
 RUS_take_care_arab_desc:0 "While we were in the process of leaving behind our beautiful motherland, we didn’t pay much attention to who exactly we were saving.
