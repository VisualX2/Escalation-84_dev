 UAS_cure_radiation_desc:0 "The sad and defining legacy of WW3, and it is still plaguing our populous, even here. But thanks to our acquired knowledge on magic, and help from the generous natives, we might be finally able to bring an end to its sickening hold on the American people."

There was simply no way to transport our entire industry and all of our machinery into this land, such a feat is practically impossible.

 UAS_star_banner:0 "Star-Spangled Banner"
 UAS_star_banner_desc:0 "Despite the loss of our great continent and beautiful world, we have managed to strive once more in this brave new land, like the pilgrims before us.

 UAS_armement_workshop:0 "Military Workshops"

 UAS_deal_with_the_locals_desc:0 "We've established ourseleves quite nicely, and it's time we turn our attention to the natives. Ponies, they're as bright and colorful as a rainbow, while griffions are something straight out of our mythology. However, they have their own ways of life and traditions, and have shown to be just as intelligent as humans.

 UAS_negotiate_with_the_locals:0 "The Griffons"
 UAS_negotiate_with_the_locals_desc:0 "New Mareland is a mostly homogeneous colony, yet there are still Griffons minorities living all across the country.

Perhaps we can try to open a dialogue between the two parties, and figure something out."

 UAS_pony_council:0 "Ponies and Griffons in the Government?"
 UAS_pony_council_desc:0 "The demand that many have feared and looked forward to, has arrived. Ponies and Griffons have united together in one voice to announce they want positions in the US Government, espcially to represent their communities.

Despite massive backlash, we shall be supporting them for the sake of our national security."

 UAS_sec_support_republican_desc:0 "We've recently been briefed by the CIA, informing us that there is still a large democratic resistance present in Aquileia, only awaiting the right moment to spark another grand revolution.

 UAS_support_discret:0 "Strengthen Ties with the Discrets"
 UAS_support_discret_desc:0 "Even if we support the ideals of freedom, challenging a relatively powerful country right off the bat would be extremely dangerous. Establishing a small, but not too big lend-lease, will make them a bit more friendly to us."

 UAS_contact_gri_republic:0 "Contact the Republic"
 UAS_contact_gri_republic_desc:0 "In the north of Griffonia lies the Griffonian Republic, a rebel state originated from the remnants of a republican revolution that took place in he Griffonian Empire.

From what we're told, it's one of the oldest surviving countries on this continent, and even though it's nothing but a shadow of its former self, it is still a great power to be reckoned with.

 UAS_summit_canterlot_desc:0 "The capital of Equestria is the perfect place to have the summit, seeing as it is neutral, and accessable ground for all the involved nations. Once we get the response from Princess Celestia and Luna about our request, we shall see how well this submit goes."

 UAS_destroy_aquilea_desc:0 "Aquileia is an unstable and treacherous land. Ever since the Empire's dirty claws were removed from it, nothing but discord and violence has occured in this disgusting land.

 UAS_crush_USSR_desc:0 "Those vile communist roaches are the sole reason Earth lies barren and dead! They're the sole reason the remnants of our great civilization lie in a cold radioactive tomb!

 UAS_crush_UEN:0 "Their True Overlords"
 UAS_crush_UEN_desc:0 "The European Union is nothing but a sad conglomerate of weak, quarrelsome, and pathetic European countries; a disjointed country created out of desperation. They have been relient on the power and might of the United States and the Soviet Union since the end of WWII, eating away at our resources like a parasite. They're spoiled and weak, and haven't lifed a damn finger to do anything seriously substanial in decades! They will be an easy target, and taking them out will gives us a much needed foothold into Equus."

 UAS_defended:0 "This We'll Defend"
 UAS_defended_desc:0 "The American Armed Forces took more than just a beating back on Earth. We lost more than half of our qualified personnel in the ground forces, forcing us to draft massive numbers of green reserves into our military. Even if some are quite motivated and eager...they seriously lack training. This contrasts severely with some other units like the Armored, which are composed mostly of regulars and veterans. \nEven with this, they have all pledged to defend our country, and that's the most important part."

 UAS_train_NG:0 "Train the National Guard"
 UAS_train_NG_desc:0 "The National Guard plays one of the biggest parts in composing our ground forces, mostly composed of volunteers, conscripts, and draftees.

 UAS_armored_way_desc:0 "Infantry is without a doubt important, and the backbone of warfare as we know it. But in this world, our technology is far more advanced than the natives, with some of them still being stuck in a medieval state of society. We should take advantage of that factor, and begin the development of more Armored vehicles, so that our army can have the advantage of technological superiority over the natives."

 UAS_reform_infantry:0 "Reform the Infantry"
 UAS_reform_infantry_desc:0 "Its not just the National guard that needed a makeover, but our entire infantry force needs one as well! Tanks and other armored vehicles are very important on the battlefield, yes, but without infantry to support them, they might as well be useless! We need start the process of reformation immediately."

 UAS_artillery:0 "Field Artillery"
 UAS_artillery_desc:0 "‘King of Battle’ \nThere is a reason artillery is one of the corner stones of ground combat. After all, it was artillery that Napoléon used to conquer almost all of Europe in the Napoleonic Wars.

 UAS_airland_battle:0 "Airland Battle"
 UAS_airland_battle_desc:0 "One of our newest doctrines that was being developed in 1982.

 UAS_CAS:0 "Close air support"
 UAS_CAS_desc:0 "‘Not a step without air cover!’ \nThe United States Air Force was without a doubt, the most powerful in the world. Capable of guarding the heavens, and any enemy incursion on our air force usually resulted in failure.

 UAS_patton:0 "Patton Series"
 UAS_patton_desc:0 "Named after General George S. Patton, The Patton was our Main battle tank until the introduction of the Abrams. Just like Patton himself, the Patton tank has shown to be a reliable tank series, and it has plenty of combat experience to show for that.

 UAS_biological_warfare_desc:0 "‘A Bio Weapon use biological toxins or infectious agents such as bacteria, viruses and fungi with the intent to kill or incapacitate humans, animals or plants as an act of war.’ \nSo goes the definition of bio weapons. Even though these terrible weapons were banned in 1972, our current situation is far too dire to leave out a field of warfare as damaging and powerful as this one. Biological weapons should help us when besieging the enemy... Let's just hope to God this don’t backfire."

 UAS_napalm:0 "Napalm"
 UAS_napalm_desc:0 "‘Napalm is an incendiary mixture of a gelling agent and a volatile petrochemical used to create a deadly incendiary weapon generally delivered by plane.‘ \nNapalm was a widely used chemical weapon during our fight in Vietnam, and something like napalm could help us greatly in this world; especially since no other nation seems to know of its existance. Dropping one or two canisters near or on enemy positions should be enough to break their morale and send them scattering."

 UAS_phosphorus:0 "White Phosphorus"
 UAS_phosphorus_desc:0 "‘White phosphorus is a material with many militaries uses, tracer, smoke screen... But It’s also used as an offensive weapon creating deadly cloud and can burn an entire area and everything in it.’ \nWhite Phosphorus is an absolutely terrible weapon to use, some would even consider it dishonorable, and rightly so.

 UAS_DU_Shell:0 "Depleted Uranium Shell"
 UAS_DU_Shell_desc:0 "‘Depleted uranium round is vastly used in heavy ammo to enhance the penetrating capacity against armoured target.’ Our talented military engineers managed to developed a powerful and effective anti-tank ammo with depleted uranium. Adding depleted uranium into our anti-tank munitions will without a doubt increase the effectiveness of it. However, before taking this step forward, we should be aware that this will result in contamination of the impact zone, and may harm our ground troops in the long term."

 UAS_reform_USMC:0 "Reform the USMC"
 UAS_reform_USMC_desc:0 "The USMC, or The United States Marine Corps, is one of our finest branches of military. Mostly used to fight in landing zones, and as a naval infantry, it’s quite an autonomous and proud branch. With having access to its own air, artillery, and armored branch, its already an incredible fighting force in itself. But, in order to make the USMC an envy of the world once more, we will need to make it even more effective than it once was."

 UAS_the_new_army:0 "The New Army"
 UAS_the_new_army_desc:0 "The Armed Forces of the United States have come a long way since we began the reforms. While she isn't as powerful as she once was before the war, our proud military is still very well strong enough to accomplish its job of protecting and preserving the freedom of all Americans! \n\n‘First to fight for the right, and to build the Nation’s might, And the Army Goes Rolling Along...’"

 UAS_SA_unit_support:0 "Support from SA units"
 UAS_SA_unit_support_desc:0 "Within our military, there are units of South Americans composed of draftees and volunteers, and we have long suspected they have their own intentions to overthrow the government.
