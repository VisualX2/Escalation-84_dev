We need to see what kind of place we're situated in before setting up our temporary habitation camps and begin the process of rebuilding civilization."

 UAS_educate_the_peoples_desc:0 "Even if we find ourselves in a situation of great emergency, we mustn't forget that knowledge is power, and the American youth are the future.

 UAS_techno_magic_institute:0 "New Washington's University of Magic"
 UAS_techno_magic_institute_desc:0 "This new world has presented us with an unbelievable natural force, a force the locals call Magic.

Therefore, we'll be establishing the first University of Magic on American soil!"

 UAS_cure_radiation:0 "Down with the Radiation!"
 UAS_cure_radiation_desc:0 "The sad and defining legacy of WWIII, and it is still plaguing our populous, even here. But thanks to our acquired knowledge on magic, and help from the generous natives, we might be finally able to bring an end to its sickening hold on the American people."

 UAS_re_industrialisation:0 "Re-Industrialisation"
 UAS_re_industrialisation_desc:0 "The capablities of the portals we created were limited. There was simply no way to transport the entire American industry and all of our machinery into this land, such a feat was practically impossible.

By establishing the Free Trade Area of the Americas, we can bring the South Americans closer to us by showing them they're just as important."

 UAS_star_banner:0 "Star-Spangled Banner"
 UAS_star_banner_desc:0 "Despite the loss of our great continent and beautiful world, we have managed to strive once more in this brave new land, like the pilgrims before us.

 UAS_armement_workshop:0 "Military Workshops"

 UAS_develop_new_weapons_desc:0 "Magic has done more than just interest the many officers of our military. It holds almost godlike power and capibilites, many that can revolutionize warfare as we know it. Our scientists and officers have been more than eager to weaponize it, and use it for everyday life.

 UAS_deal_with_the_locals_desc:0 "We've established ourseleves quite nicely, and it's time we turn our attention to the natives. Ponies, they're as bright and colorful as a rainbow, while griffions are something straight out of our mythology. However, they have their own ways of life and traditions, and have shown to be just as intelligent as humans. They are clearly intimidated by our gargantuan numbers, and we've been asked to respect the autonomy of their towns and villages. Do we want a repeat of the Native Americans?"

 UAS_negotiate_with_the_locals:0 "The Griffons"
 UAS_negotiate_with_the_locals_desc:0 "New Mareland is a mostly homogeneous colony, yet there are still Griffons minorities living all across the country. They themselves aren't bothering us much, in fact many have actually taken a liking to us, however their old rivalry with Ponies is still rampent. Perhaps we can try to open a dialogue between the two parties, and figure something out."

 UAS_pony_council:0 "Ponies and Griffons in the Government?"
 UAS_pony_council_desc:0 "The demand that many have feared and looked forward to, has arrived. Ponies and Griffons have united together in one voice to announce they want positions in the US Government, especially to represent their communities.

 UAS_Aquilean_civil_war:0 "Revolution in Aquileia"
 UAS_Aquilean_civil_war_desc:0 "To our north lies Aquileia, a country plagued by a domestic conflict between Republicans and Royalists.

 UAS_Send_the_red_cross_desc:0 "This civil war is looking like it's going to decimate Aquileia.

The citizens of Aquileia shall be protected and given the aid they deserve."

 UAS_support_revolution:0 "Support the Republicans"
 UAS_support_revolution_desc:0 "The people of Aquileia have risen up against their oppressors! Centuries ago, nations all across the Americas, from Mexico, to Argentina, rose up against their oppressors, and created countries free of their decadent and inept overlords. To not help the Aquileian Republican cause would be to betray the dreams of our founding fathers! We shall send volunteers immediately"

 UAS_support_monarchist:0 "Support the Monarchists"

But...not only do they want their country to have a stable and clear future, but they're pretty isolationist, and it's unlikey they would attack us. Despite massive backlash, we shall be supporting them for the sake of our national security."

 UAS_last_stand_desc:0 "This...is not like any other war we fought. If we lose now, America, our civilization, all of it will cease to exist as we know it. This is our last stand!

 UAS_Embassy_sunset:0 "Establish an Embassy in Sunset"

 UAS_contact_Aquilea:0 "Contact Aquileia"

 UAS_sec_support_republican_desc:0 "We've recently been briefed by the CIA, informing us that there is still a large democratic resistance present in Aquileia, only awaiting the right moment to spark another grand revolution. For the sake of freedom across the continent, we should support them as discretely as possible."

 UAS_support_discret:0 "Strengthen Ties with the Discrets"
 UAS_support_discret_desc:0 "Even if we support the ideals of freedom, challenging a relatively powerful country right off the bat would be extremely dangerous. Establishing a small, but not too big lend-lease, will make them a bit more friendly to us."

 UAS_contact_gri_republic:0 "Contact the Republic"
 UAS_contact_gri_republic_desc:0 "In the north of Griffonia lies the Griffonian Republic, a rebel state originated from the remnants of a republican revolution that took place in the Griffonian Empire.

From what we're told, it's one of the oldest surviving countries on this continent, and even though it's nothing but a shadow of its former self, it is still a great power to be reckoned with.

 UAS_destroy_aquilea:0 "Defuse the Aquileian Powder Keg"
 UAS_destroy_aquilea_desc:0 "Aquileia is an unstable and treacherous land. Ever since the Empire's dirty claws were removed from it, nothing but discord, violence, and anarchy has occured in these lawless and disgusting lands.

 UAS_landing_hauckland:0 "Landing at Hauckland"

 UAS_invade_Commonwealth_desc:0 "The Commonwealth of New Mareland is nothing but a puny puppet of Equestria, weak and submissive to their overlords, the same overlords who put on a idiotic play pretending to be demigods.

 UAS_crush_USSR:0 "Operation Unthinkable"
 UAS_crush_USSR_desc:0 "Those communist roaches are the sole reason Earth lies barren and dead! They're the sole reason the remnants of our great civilization lie in a cold radioactive tomb!

No more, once and for all we will rain ALL hell upon the vile communist rats!"

 UAS_crush_UEN:0 "Their True Overlords"
 UAS_crush_UEN_desc:0 "The UEN is nothing but a sad conglomerate of weak, quarrelsome, and pathetic European countries. They have been relient on the might of the US since the end of WWII, eating away at our resources like a parasite. They're spoiled and weak, and haven't lifed a damn finger to do anything substanial in decades! Invading them gives us a much needed foothold into Equus. This time, America is the colonizer!"
 
 UAS_fall_of_griffonia:0 "The Fall of Griffonia"

 UAS_invite_UEN_desc:0 "Seeing as they were already our ally back home, it's more than reasonable and sensible to invite our European friends to our alliance. We've done and accomplished so many things together, and we shall continue that legacy with Europe on this strange new world."

 UAS_defended:0 "This We'll Defend"
 UAS_defended_desc:0 "The American Armed Forces took more than just a beating back on Earth. We lost more than half of our qualified personnel in the war, forcing us to draft massive numbers of greens into our military. Even if some are quite motivated and eager...they seriously lack training. Even with this, they have all pledged to defend our country, and that's the most vital part."

 UAS_train_NG:0 "Train the National Guard"
 UAS_train_NG_desc:0 "The National Guard plays one of the biggest parts in composing our ground forces. Composed mostly of volunteers, conscripts, and draftees, they're the beating heart of America's Armed Forces. They're undertrained though, and since the tempest of political tension appears to be calm for the moment, we should take the time and effort to train our national guard."

 UAS_armored_way:0 "The Armored Way"
 UAS_armored_way_desc:0 "Infantry is without a doubt important and the backbone of warfare as we know it. Our technology is far more advanced than the natives, with some of them still stuck in a backwards medieval society.

 UAS_reform_infantry:0 "Reform the Infantry"
 UAS_reform_infantry_desc:0 "Its not just the National guard that needed a makeover, but our entire infantry force needs one as well! Tanks and other armored vehicles are very important on the battlefield, yes, but without infantry to support them, they might as well be hunks of metal just waiting to be shot. We need start the process of reformation immediately."

 UAS_artillery:0 "Field Artillery"
 UAS_artillery_desc:0 "‘King of Battle’ \nThere is a reason artillery is one of the corner stones of ground combat. After all, it was artillery that Napoléon used to conquer almost all of Europe in the Napoleonic Wars.

 UAS_airland_battle:0 "Airland Battle"
 UAS_airland_battle_desc:0 "One of our newest doctrines that was being developed in 1982.

 UAS_CAS:0 "Close air support"
 UAS_CAS_desc:0 "‘Not a step without air cover!’ \nThe United States Air Force was without a doubt, the most powerful in the world. Capable of guarding the heavens, any enemy incursion on our air force usually resulted in failure.

 UAS_patton:0 "Patton Series"
 UAS_patton_desc:0 "Named after General George S. Patton, the Patton was our Main battle tank until the introduction of the Abrams.

Let's just hope to God this doesn't backfire..."

 UAS_napalm:0 "Napalm"
 UAS_napalm_desc:0 "‘Napalm is an incendiary mixture of a gelling agent and a volatile petrochemical used to create a deadly incendiary weapon generally delivered by plane. Napalm was a widely used chemical weapon in Vietnam, and napalm could help us greatly in this world; especially since no other nation seems to have it. Dropping one or two canisters near or on enemy positions should be enough to destroy them and morale."

 UAS_phosphorus:0 "White Phosphorus"
 UAS_phosphorus_desc:0 "‘White phosphorus is a chemical with many militaries uses, but It’s infamously used as an offensive weapon, creating a deadly cloud that can burn an entire area, flesh, and everything in it. White Phosphorus is an absolutely terrible weapon to use, some would even consider it dishonorable. But, unfortunately sometimes one doesn't get a choice, especially when the survival of our species is at stake."

 UAS_DU_Shell:0 "Depleted Uranium Shell"
 UAS_DU_Shell_desc:0 "‘Depleted uranium is used in heavy ammo to enhance the penetrating capacity against armoured targets. Our military engineers have developed a powerful and effective anti-tank round with depleted uranium, and adding depleted uranium into our anti-tank munitions will increase the power of them. However, we should be aware that this will result in contamination of the impact zone, and may harm our troops."

 UAS_reform_USMC:0 "Reform the USMC"
 UAS_reform_USMC_desc:0 "The USMC, or The United States Marine Corps, is one of our finest branches of military. Mostly used to fight in naval landing zones or overseas, it’s quite an autonomous and proud branch. With having access to its own military assets, its already an incredible fighting force in itself. In order to make the USMC an envy of the world once more, we will need to make it more effective than it once was."

 UAS_the_new_army:0 "The New Army"
 UAS_the_new_army_desc:0 "The Armed Forces of the United States have come a long way since we began the reforms. While she isn't as powerful as she once was before the war, our proud military is still very well strong enough to accomplish its job of protecting and preserving the freedom of all Americans! \n\n‘First to fight for the right, and to build the Nation’s might, And the Army Goes Rolling Along...’"

 UAS_construct_airbase:0 "Construct an Airbase"

However, these brave men are filled with a patrotic fervor and vehement determination to protect those they love and have left, and that spirit is the very spirit that brings civilizations back from the ashes. To our surprise however, a division of Brazilian national guards have offered their assistance to us in our remobilization efforts, and all the generals were quick to accept the offer of assistance.

Recognizing the precarious situation our country lies in now applies to them and their lives, many brave and determined natives have sworn alligency to the United States of America and her ideals, and are now currently engaged in ensuring the security of our country. \nBetter yet, two native volunteers have finished their Officer classes and are ready to be assigned to help lead our armies. \nThere was no comment from the Army council."

Where there should be nothing but wilderness, an artifical road was discovered at the north of our position. There's no doubt that...something built this, whatever 'it' is. But oddly there isn't any sight of habitation nearby, but the 4th Scout section reported seeing that struck fear into their hearts, that being the faint silhouette of a city in the distance.

But these aren't any average ponies we're used to, they come in all different shades of the rainbow, softer looking fur, big pronouced eyes, and they're fully sapient. There's apparently a population of...griffons as well. The same Griffons out of our mythology. There was an intense and startling stand-off between our the scouts and the local police force of the city, but thankfully everything was settled out...

While there is no law for an interspecies couple, the request was refused and the couple was violently expulsed. It's now become a serious and explosive issue, one that our media is oh so happy to exploit for viewership and cash, but makes our job even harder.
